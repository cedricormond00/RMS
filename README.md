## General description of project
This project is a remote monitoring system to be used on the [Blue Diversion Autarky Project](https://www.eawag.ch/en/research/humanwelfare/wastewater/projects/autarky/), developed at EAWAG. 

The waterfall, currently only a prototype, requires that an operator come onsite regularly, to monitor the microbial water quality in the clean water tank. This is time-consuming and limits the possibility of performing high-quality field tests.
This project aims to tackle this challenge by providing a real-time, online microbial water quality monitoring. This ensures that the water is of sufficiently high microbial water quality such that the waterwall may be used at no risk for the user. 

A machine model was developed by XXX link, and implemented here. The only parameter is the ORP reading. Decision making of water being safe or unsafe is based on a cut-off value found from the trained model.
For example a XXX and LRT XXX, the ORP value was found to be at. 
For varying values, 


## User guide
The project is divided in 3 folders
- final project

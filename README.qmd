This project is a remote monitoring system to be used on the [Blue Diversion Autarky Project](https://www.eawag.ch/en/research/humanwelfare/wastewater/projects/autarky/), developed at EAWAG [@RN32]. 

The waterfall, currently only a prototype, requires that an operator come onsite regularly, to monitor the microbial water quality in the clean water tank. This is time-consuming and limits the possibility of performing high-quality field tests.
This project aims to tackle this challenge by providing a real-time, online microbial water quality monitoring. This ensures that the water is of sufficiently high microbial water quality such that the waterwall may be used at no risk for the user. 

A machine model was developed by XXX link, and implemented here. The only parameter is the ORP reading. Decision making of water being safe or unsafe is based on a cut-off value found from the trained model.
For example a XXX and LRT XXX, the ORP value was found to be at. 
For varying values, 




# User guide
<!--- The project is divided in 3 folders 
- final project
- RTC calibration
- ML model --->
## final_project
This folder contains the source code for the project.
To use the system, clone the repo, assemble the hardware as described in XXX (report DOI, + section link of circuit structure) and upload the platformIO project to the board.
Once uploaded, the device will automatically start. 

## Configuration settings
If the device is used for the first time, make sure the device is connected to a PC. This will help for debugging potential mis-settings. 

The first automatic run will create a RMS_V1.CFG file, with default, hard-coded settings. Once the device has run at least run, you can safely disconnect all power supply, remove the SD card, and easily tune the configuration settings.

Alternatively, if you can easily upload the RMS_V1.CFG file to the SD card before the first run. RMS_V1.CFG can be found in XXX (folder location on github)

### Configuration parameters
_logitThreshold_ : (mv) any ORP reading above this value will translate into a safe waterquality. This setting is found from running the code found in XXX.

_uraPressDuration_ : (ms) how long the user should press the button for an alarm to be raised. In case an SMS has already been sent less then _uraSMSInterval_, only a water monitoring will occur, but no SMS will be spamming the user.

_hbTargetHour_ : (hour, 24) At what time should a heartbeat be sent to the operator.

_hbIntervalHour_ : (hour) At what frequency should the heartbeat be sent, starting from the _hbTargetHour_. Ensure this value is less or equal to 24. For example, consider _hbTargetHour_ = 9 and _hbIntervalHour_ = 6. A heartbeat will be sent to the operator at 9:00, 15:00, 21:00, 03:00. Please note that the exact time at which a heartbeat is sent is the closest time to the aforementioned full hour, plus a maximum of _xwqSleepPeriod_. Indeed the heartbeat SMS is sent after the device woke up for a watermonitoring function.

_swqSleepPeriod_ : (ms) how much time should elapse between two water monitoring events, while the water quality is safe.

_uwqSleepPeriod_ : (ms) how much time should elapse between two water monitoring events, while the water quality is unsafe.

_fwqSleepPeriod_ : (ms) how much time should elapse between two water monitoring events, while there has been faulty reading.

_uraSMSInterval_ : (ms) how much time should elapse, before a new SMS can be sent to the operator, informing them that the user raised an alarm. This is to prevent spamming the operator with notifications in case the user uses too often the button press

_wmSMSInterval_ : (ms) how much time should elapse, before a new SMS can be sent to the operator, updating them on the waterquality status, after an unsafe or faulty reading was first detected. This is to prevent spamming the operator with notification in the case of unsafe water quality or faulty reading.

_sendSMS_ : (boolean) sets whether the SMS should be sent to the operator or not.

_remoteNumberLength_ : (integer) tells how long the operator phone number is.

_remoteNumber_ : (string) holds the operator phone number.


### LED error signal description

In case the RMS is started without being connected to a PC, the LEDs provide some feedback in case some problems occured during initialisation. There is always one or two LEDs on, to indicate what region is affected, while another LED will blink to differentiate between the possible causes for the issue.

| Region 	| Exact problem 	| On LED 	| Blinking LED 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Battery 	| Battery not conected 	| Orange 	| Red 	|
| Battery 	| Low battery energy level 	| Orange 	| Yellow 	|
| SD Card 	| Failed to initialise 	| Green 	| Red 	|
| SD Card 	| Failed to create a valid filename 	| Green 	| Yellow 	|
| SMS 	| Inappropriate phone number 	| Yellow 	| Red 	|

# Impreovements

## codebase
### wake up from deepsleep, from low battery
If the RMS is off the grid power, and has been running on the battery for some time, the battery voltage will drop. We have set a batteryEmptyVoltage at 3.5V. If the voltage drops below 3.5V + 5%3.5V, the device enters a "criticalEL" state, and must go to deepSleep, so as to consume as little as power possibe, while informing the user that the device is not running.

However, if the grid power eventually turns back on, we want the device to be able to power back up. For this to occur, we have implemented some measures to ensure the device wakes back up. Just before going to sleep, we attach an interrupt from the PMIC to the arduino. That way, if the PMIC detects a stable power supply, it may interrupt the Arduino, thus waking it up.

Because of the amount of time it takes to deplete the battery, thorough test could not be performed

What remains to be tested, is whether the device can effectively carry on its usual business after the device has woken up from a deep sleep.

Also, we want to know what happens when the battery voltage gets too low. Will the circuit disconnect?

### Storage optimisation
Currently, a lot of variables are being stored inside the rms class. Some of which are updated during the setup phase with values from the configuration struct. These values where either read from the SD card, or set from the default settings. This is the case for 
- SWQ sleep duration
- UWQ sleep duration
- FWQ sleep duration

### Adding new sensors to the predicting algorithm
Nonetheless, if one wants to include more sensors, the following steps should be included to the function `FSM_implementMLDecision`

  * Using the code, accessible from the paper [11]
	  + Extract the standardization parameters (mean + SD) from the training dataset
	  + Extract the PCA components from the training dataset
	  + Extract the Î² and Î±~0~, â€¦, Î±~n~ parameters from the model 
  * Extract the most conservative threshold probability, based on target values set (LRTMS2, or LogICC)
  * Standardize the input parameters, using the input parameter from the trained model
  * PCA the input parameters, using the input parameter from the trained model
  * Pass the transformed input parameters, into the probability function $p={e^{Î²+Î±_{0}+...+Î±_{n}}}{1+e^{Î²+Î±_{0}+...+Î±_{n}}}$
  * Compute the probability
  * Compare the probability with the probability limit found from training
